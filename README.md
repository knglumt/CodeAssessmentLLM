# CodeAssessmentLLM

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) files and supporting resources for automated code assessments. 
The project leverages **ChatGPT API** and **Llama (local version)** via **Ollama** to evaluate and provide grades on programming submissions for entry-level lessons.
